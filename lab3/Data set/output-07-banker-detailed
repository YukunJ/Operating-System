During 0-1 each task completes its initiate

During 1-2
   Task 1 completes its request (i.e. the request is granted)
   Task 2 completes its request (i.e. the request is granted)
   Task 3's request cannot be granted

During 2-3
   First check blocked tasks:
       task 3's request cannot be granted
   Task 1 releases
   Task 2 completes its request (see below)

During 3-4
   First check blocked tasks:
       task 3's request cannot be granted
   Task 1's request cannot be granted
   Task 2's request exceeds its claim; aborted; 2 units available next cycle

During 4-5
   First check blocked tasks:
       Task 3 completes its request
       Task 1's request cannot be granted

During 5-6
   First check blocked tasks:
       Task 1's request cannot be granted
   Task 3 completes its request

During 6-7
   First check blocked tasks:
       Task 1's request cannot be granted
   Task 3 releases and is finished (at 7)

During 7-8
   First check blocked tasks:
       Task 1 completes its request

During 8-9
   Task 1 releases and is finished (at 9)


NOTE:  The reason task 2 could complete its request during 2-3 is
*NOT* because task 1 did a release.  The released item is not
available until 3-4.  The reason is that the state is safe *without*
the item task 1 is releasing.  Task 3's request, if granted, would
have lead to an unsafe state.
