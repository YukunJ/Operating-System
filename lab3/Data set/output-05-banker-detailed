During 0-1 each task completes its initiate.

During 1-2
   Task 1 completes its request for 1 of 1 (i.e. the request is granted)
   Task 2 completes its request for 1 of 1 (i.e. the request is granted)
   Task 3's request for 2 of 1 cannot be granted (not safe).  So 3 is blocked

During 2-3
   Banker first checks blocked tasks but cannot grant 3's request (not safe)
   task 1 releases 1 of 1
   task 2 requests 1 of 1 and it is granted (See below for crucial comment)

During 3-4
   Banker first checks blocked tasks but cannot grant 3's request (not safe)
   task 1's request for 3 of 1 cannot be granted.  So 1 is blocked.
   task 2 releases and is finished (at 4)

During 4-5
   Banker checks and can satisfy 3's request (check 3 BEFORE 1)
   Banker checks but cannot satisfy 1's request

During 5-6
   Banker checks but cannot satisfy 1's request
   Task 3 issues a request that is granted

During 6-7
   Banker checks but cannot satisfy 1's request
   Task 3 releases and is finished (at 7)

During 7-8
   Banker checks and can satisfy 1's request

During 8-9
   Task 1 releases and is finished (at 9)


Crucial comment.

Do *NOT* make the mistake of thinking that the reason task 2's request
was granted during 2-3 was because task 1 released a resource during
2-3.  That is *NOT* the reason.  The resource released during 2-3 is
not available until the 3-4 interval.  The reason task 2's request was
granted was that the state is such that granting the request is safe.

Please note that at this one instant (time 2) it is safe to grant the
request of task 2 and *NOT* safe to grant the request of task 3.
